Labor Day 2020 was a watershed moment for me: it was my first company holiday since starting Honeywell in July (yay for being an accounting shill!). Before working, I didn’t fully appreciate the obligatory days off my school or part-time work gave me - I would spend these free hours studying or lying around eating peanut butter and pretzels and watching Gossip Girl.</description></item><item><title>From Meaty Minestrone to Colorful Fiesta Bowls: My Fave Recipes from the Spoon University Cookbook</title><link>https://littlecurrywurst.com/blog/spoon-cookbook/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littlecurrywurst.com/blog/spoon-cookbook/</guid><description>Stepping out of my culinary comfort zone with easy and semi-fancy recipes.
It’s about fifteen years too late, but my childhood dream of becoming a chef is finally being realized - the twinkle is in my brown eye, my face is dusted in bleached flour and I toss the phrase “just eyeball it” around like it’s my most beloved cliché.

It’s a weird confession, but I woke up one Saturday late-morning and was itching to rollerblade around like a bar of Dial soap was strapped to my feet. I’ve never been good with “rollie” activities like roller skating, longboarding, ice skating, etc. My hands drip sheets of sweat, my heart starts pounding and my mind shows lovely films of my brain matter splatting on a dirty sidewalk.</description></item><item><title>Four and a Quarter Hours on the Hawthorne Trail</title><link>https://littlecurrywurst.com/blog/hawthorne/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littlecurrywurst.com/blog/hawthorne/</guid><description>Teeming Cyprus grove on the trail fringes
The Hawthorne Trail: the epic, serpentine rail-turned-trail that graces Gainesville’s backyard and offers a smooth 32 miles of uninterrupted earth and clarity. I first started biking the Hawthorne Trail when I acquired Luna, a mint-green Admiral Schwinn with sticky gears and a seat that resembled a tortoiseshell. I was never a serious biker before I bought Luna. I would hop on the odd beach cruiser at home and wind throughout my neighborhood like it was the suburban Tour-de-France.</description></item></channel></rss>
