Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are infamous for their drunken swings and depression lows, causing dilettantes to either invest like hungry sailors or jump ship like the blockchain is aflame. Before Bitcoin gave us a hope of a trustless, decentralized financial system actually coming to fruition, I started studying cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology in October 2020. I had no clue about blockchain’s potential and only heard vague whispers about crypto fanatics and the FASB twiddling their thumbs on accounting for digital assets.</p><p>I wanted to get into the tech industry and possibly find a new career, and crypto was a total shot in the dark. I lucked out because my boyfriend’s roommate is an integrations engineer for the Maker Foundation, the organization behind the MakerDAO protocol and the Dai stablecoin.

In my words, crypto is an intangible asset who’s store of value is enabled and confirmed by blockchain technology, which acts as a decentralized computer with different nodes (i.e. individual computers) on the network continuously verifying transactions and adding them in blocks to the chain. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Eth have their own protocols (sets of rules in the software) and separate blockchain ecosystems; other smaller crypto assets like altcoins or NFTs live on top of these established networks. Blockchain is a giant accounting ledger with stores of values being debited or credited to various accounts. For an ultradeep look at Bitcoin that provides historical context, I highly recommend

This idea - that crypto assets were intangible yet they still commanded real value - flummoxed me until I remembered the <em>The Scent of Money</em> chapter in <em>Sapiens</em> by Yuval Noah Harari. He wrote,</p><p><em>“&mldr;money isn’t a material value - it is a psychological construct. It works by converting matter into mind&mldr;trust is the raw material from which all types of money are minted. When a wealthy farmer sold his possessions for a sack of cowry shells and travelled with them to another province, he trusted that upon reaching his destination other people would be willing to sell him rice, houses and a field in exchange for the shells.” (page 180)</em></p><p>As the example illustrates, the concept of money - whether it be fiat or a gold standard - is a construct that human imagination gives value to. Discovering this made me question the real value of my Chase bank account and wonder if <em>anything</em> in this life has inherent, indisputable value. Love, maybe.</p><p>Back to the agenda though: <strong>beginner resources for understanding cryptocurrencies.</strong> During a Phoenix Crypto meeting, I stressed that crypto is like a college class you have to study for and ace. Especially if you’re investing, not doing your homework can ruin you financially and lead to an overall bad taste for crypto.</p><ul><li><p>My first recommendation is watching

Not knowing how to code is a barrier if you’re looking to be a developer and build applications. If you’re a thoughtful investor, the story is a little different, but having a fundamental understanding of how blockchain works is paramount.</p><p>The good news is that coding is (theoretically) an easily acquired skill, and the resources for learning are 1) cheap, 2) abundant and 3) community-based. My first recommendation is starting with online courses such as Codecademy, Udemy, Coursera, etc - I wouldn’t enroll in a bootcamp right away (they can be expensive with mixed results) but would instead rely on the power of self-learning. Crypto tends to woo those who are teetering on the edge of total crypto addiction - and once that happens, you’ll seek and absorb crypto knowledge like it’s your breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnight snack.</p><p>I started with
<a href=https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-blockchain target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn the Basics of Blockchain</a> on Codecademy; it’s a two-part course that covers the theory of blockchain and teaches you how to build a mini-blockchain using Python. I realized I didn’t know anything about Python, so I put myself through the
<a href=https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Python 3</a> course on Codecademy in tangent. Then I had to figure out how to use
<a href=https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Git</a> to upload my work in VSCode to Github, and the snowball rolled furiously down the coding hill. It’s funny how coding is something I enjoy as an adult when I hated it in high school - the tools for learning have 10x-ed in their design and methods of explaining, and I wish Codecademy was around when I was 17.</p><p>Once you have a grip on basic coding concepts, it’s time to get specific and learn the language of crypto protocols - in the case of Ethereum, that means learning Solidity so you can write your own smart contracts on the platform.
<a href=https://ethereum.org/en/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum.org</a> has brilliant developer resources and documentation and even links to
<a href=https://cryptozombies.io/en/solidity target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">CryptoZombies</a>, an interactive game that helps you learn Solidity while killing the roving undead. Udemy also has a great
<a href=https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Solidity course</a> and countless other blockchain/Bitcoin/Altcoin/Ethereum courses (and they’re always on sale!)</p><p>In my experience, the technical challenge of programming wasn’t as large as understanding the theory of digital currencies. Coding is intuitive and stamped into everyday life, whereas the ideas of mining, Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, nonces, merkle trees and protocols are mind-numbing. What hell does it all mean? Once those pieces fall into place and your mental framework is solidified, then adding code into the equation is the cherry on top.</p><p>If you’re looking to be a miner or validator in the protocols, that adds another layer of technical complexities beyond the scope of this article. I recommend reading the Ethereum.org resources on
<a href=https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">staking</a> to get started (but beware, being an active node uses a ton of computing resources, racks up utility bills and is overall unsustainable for the planet in its current form. Switching from

<a href=https://www.cityam.com/almost-a-fifth-of-all-us-dollars-were-created-this-year/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">20% of the total supply of dollars</a>. If we think about the classic supply and demand curve, it’s clear that an increase in the supply leads to a drop in price - or value - of an asset, which goes hand in hand with rampant inflation. The fact that governments can print whatever money they want - and the only thing backing that money is collective trust in said government - is terrifying. In the case of Bitcoin, politics are (mostly) backseat while the total money supply is capped at 21 million Bitcoins forever. Inflation resistance started looking attractive to individual and institutional investors in 2020, when the interest rates on their assets essentially went to zero.</p><figure><img src=/article_images/crypto/meme.jpg alt="Meme or strategy of the Federal Reserve?"><figcaption><p><em>Meme or strategy of the Federal Reserve?</em></p></figcaption></figure><p>For the casual investor, getting into crypto markets can be daunting.
