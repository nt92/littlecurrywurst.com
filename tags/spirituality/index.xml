Heda, 1642
I recently had the chance to lead the book club for she256, a nonprofit dedicated to advancing women and minority interests in crypto. We kicked off our first meeting with Sacred Economics by Charles Eisenstein, a treatise spanning economics, self-help, monetary policy and spirituality.

The pandemic and family problems wrecked my mental health and creative drive, but after reading books like The Untethered Soul, The Surrender Experiment and Many Lives, Many Masters, a small seed of ‚Äúself‚Äù has been taking root again.</description></item></channel></rss>
